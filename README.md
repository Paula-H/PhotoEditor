# PhotoEditor

PhotoEditor is a python-driven application that allows its users to edit a given photo, applying certain filters to it.

## Installation

Using git, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone
```
Make sure to include the libraries used:
[PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html),
[tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

```bash
pip install tk
pip install Pillow
```

## Future development

For the future updates of the project, there are a few key points that would like to adjust:
- implement the filters present in the PIL library using Kernel Multiplication;

- customize the interface into a modern, minimalistic window
